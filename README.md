# Joke

Joke is a simple application whose focus is to use Dagger Android with Navigation Component with accompanying things like Coroutines, LiveData, Retrofit. In the next project, the only change will be the transition from Dagger Android to Dagger Hilt, everything else remains the same.

Also, one of the interesting things about this project is the **universal RecyclerView**, which reduces a lot of boilerplate code, so for each view we use the same recyclerview settings only with different parameters.
